## Overview

Bomberman Dynablaster ‚Äì Single Player Edition is a modern, web-based remake of the classic Bomberman series with a twist inspired by the Italian *Dynablaster* variant. The game features dynamic grid‚Äëbased levels, bomb mechanics that allow for chain reactions, strategic power‚Äëups, and clever enemy AI ‚Äì all wrapped up in a neon-retro, arcade aesthetic that works perfectly on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Features

- **Grid-Based Levels:**  
  - Play on a 15√ó13 grid with outer indestructible walls and inner destructible blocks.
  - The top‚Äëleft area is reserved for the player's safe starting zone.
  
- **Player Controls:**  
  - **Movement:** Use the Arrow keys to move smoothly from cell to cell.
  - **Action:** Press **Space** to plant bombs with a 2‚Äësecond timer.
  
- **Bomb & Explosion Mechanics:**  
  - Bombs create cross‚Äëshaped explosions that travel up, down, left, and right.
  - The blast radius is determined by your current bomb power.
  - Chain reactions: explosions can trigger nearby bombs.
  
- **Power-Up Capsules:**  
  - **Red Capsule:** (Dropped by destructible blocks at a 10% chance) Grants an extra bomb capacity for 10 seconds.
  - **Blue Capsule:** (Also at a 10% chance) Provides a temporary barrier protection for 10 seconds that prevents explosion damage.
  - Active power-ups are clearly displayed in the HUD with countdown timers.
  
- **Enemy Bots:**  
  - Enemies spawn in randomly selected empty cells (ensuring ample space) so they don‚Äôt trap themselves.
  - They are ‚Äúpurple‚Äù foes with 2 HP ‚Äì a single explosion stuns them, and a second hit eliminates them.
  - Enemies can also place bombs (with a low probability) and quickly move away to avoid self-damage.
  
- **HUD & Level Progression:**  
  - The HUD displays **Lives**, **Score**, **Level**, and details of active power-ups.
  - Levels progress automatically when all destructible blocks are cleared, awarding bonus points.
  
- **Responsive & Modern Design:**  
  - A full start screen overlay welcomes the player before the game begins.
  - The game renders on an HTML5 Canvas using a retro neon-inspired style.
  - Designed to be fully responsive on both desktop and mobile platforms.
  
- **High Score Board:**  
  - Players‚Äô names and top scores are stored in localStorage and displayed on a high score board.
